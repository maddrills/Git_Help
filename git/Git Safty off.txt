Before disabling, make sure you understand this security measure,
and why it exists.
You should not do this if your repositories are stored on a shared drive.

However, if you are the sole user of your machine 100% of the time,
 and your repositories are stored locally,
 then disabling this check should, theoretically, pose no increased risk.

Also note that you can't currently combine this with a file path,
 which would be relevant in my case.
 The command doesn't interpret the wildcard * as an operator per se â€“
 it just takes the "*" argument to mean "disable safe repository checks/ consider all repositories as safe".


git config --global --add safe.directory '*'
